## Vector:
- Vector is an object has both a magnitude and a direction.
- Vector is a matrix with single column or single row.

## Eigenvector
- A eigenvector v, is a non-zero vector that sastifies the following equation:

+ Vector v is called eigenvector of matrix A if we multiply matrix A by vector v, the new vector (lamda)v does not change direction after the transformation

## Eigenvalue
- Eigenvalue tell us how much the eigenvector changes in size when mutiplied with the matrix

- New column vector (lamda)v has same direction eigenvector.
- New column vector (lamda)v maybe either longer or shorter than eigenvector because of eigenvalue Lamda.
- Eigenvalue lamda might be negative. The direction of new vector is reversed but still on the same line
- We might find many eigenvectors of matrix A
- All vector with the same direction are actually eigenvector of matrix A
